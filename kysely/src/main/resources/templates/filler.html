		<h4>Blank Space!</h4>
		Nice to meet you, where you been?<br/>
		I could show you incredible things<br/><br/>
		Magic, madness, heaven sin<br/>
		Saw you there and I thought<br/>
		Oh my God, look at that face<br/>
		You look like my next mistake<br/>
		Love's a game, want to play?<br/><br/>
		New money, suit and tie<br/>
		I can read you like a magazine<br/>
		Ain't it funny, rumors, lie<br/>
		And I know you heard about me<br/>
		So hey, let's be friends<br/>
		I'm dying to see how this one ends<br/>
		Grab your passport and my hand<br/>
		I can make the bad guys good for a weekend<br/><br/>
		So it's gonna be forever<br/>
		Or it's gonna go down in flames<br/>
		You can tell me when it's over<br/>
		If the high was worth the pain<br/>
		Got a long list of ex-lovers<br/>
		They'll tell you I'm insane<br/>
		'Cause you know I love the players<br/>
		And you love the game<br/>
		'Cause we're young and we're reckless<br/>
		We'll take this way too far<br/>
